## Specifications

Our site, **Organiz'asso**, allows members of an association to exchange messages through forums.
The association is managed by a board of directors, made up of elected members called administrators. The platform offers two forums:

* The open forum, which every registered member can view and where they can post messages.
* The closed forum, reserved for members of the board of directors.

When not logged in, a user can only create an account. Their registration must then be approved by an administrator to be granted member status.
When a member logs in, they gain access to the main page, which includes the open forum.

**User Roles & Actions:**

* **A visitor arriving on the site can:**
    * Create an account and request member status
    * Log in

* **Once logged in, and after their registration has been approved by an administrator, a member can:**
    * Create messages:
        * In reply to an existing message
        * Or to start a new discussion
    * View their own profile, which contains at least the list of messages theyâ€™ve posted. From their profile, they can delete their own messages.
    * View the profiles of other members
    * Search for messages by specifying keywords, a time range of publication, or the author.

* **Administrators are users with additional privileges. An administrator can:**
    * Access the closed forum
    * Grant or revoke administrator status to another user (but not to themselves)
    * Review account registration requests and approve or reject member status for a user.

* **At the end of their session, a user has the option to log out.**

**Technology Stack Overview:**
* **Frontend:** React
* **Backend:** Node.js (implied)
* **Database & Authentication:** MongoDB

*(Revision Note: This version aligns the component structure with the provided dependency graph image (`image_e23876.jpg`), reinstating `LoginForm` and `RegisterForm` as separate components. It retains other previous updates like the technology stack, exclusion of Redux/Mongoose, and inclusion of the `Footer` component based on text feedback.)*
